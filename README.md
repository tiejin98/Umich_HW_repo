# Umich_HW_repo
This is a repository for what I have done in Umich. And in this repo, I will only add the courses I have graded which do not need that much code. Now, this repo have the following courses' homework:

1. 2021Fall Stats 500 Stat learning I: Regression
2. 2021Fall Stats 510 Prob Dist Theory
3. 2022Winter Stats 511 Intro to Stat Theory
4. 2022 Winter Stats 601 Statistical Learning

For other courses which have more codes such as 2021Fall Stats 507 Data Sci in Python, I create repo for their own.
